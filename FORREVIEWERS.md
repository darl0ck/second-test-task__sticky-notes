## Hello, nice to meet you !
For this project I decided to take React + scss, because this combination seemed to me the most convenient. 

I implemented some of the basic functionality, except resizing, because it seemed to me that I already sat too long on the whole task (4-5 hours)
At first I did everything nice, but then when I decided to include saving data into localstorage, because of this I had to do part of the application a little differently, but I didn't dare to rewrite everything.

In general vanilla js is used everywhere, cards are saved along with changed text, color and position. 

## Basic Features

1. To create new note double click on screen
2. Move note by dragging it itself
3. Open context menu by right click on card
4. Change card color by choosing the right feature in context menu
5. To chenge card text, click on "Note content" text
6. Remove note by dragging card on red part of the screen
7. All data saves automatically to localstorage
